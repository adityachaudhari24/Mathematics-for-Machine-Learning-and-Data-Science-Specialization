<summary>🎯Q. what is linear regression</summary>

- Its a `supervised machine learning algorithm` which collects data with input and output and then try to learn the relationship between inputs and outputs.
- It is `used for predicting continuous values`.
- Linear algebra `is all about manipulating vectors and matrices to do powerful calculations`.
- Linear regression `is all about finding the best fitting line` through a set of points in an n-dimensional space.
- Formula of linear regression is `y = mx + b` where m is slope and b is y intercept. ( m is also sometimes called as weight and b is called as bias)

<summary>🎯Q. what is singular vs non-singular system ?</summary>

- A `singular system` is a system of linear equations that does not have a unique solution. This happens when the equations are `linearly dependent`, meaning that one equation can be derived from another. In such cases, t`he system may have either no solutions or infinitely many solutions`.
- A `non-singular system` is a system of linear equations that has a unique solution. This occurs when the equations are `linearly independent`, meaning that no equation can be derived from another. In such cases, the `system has exactly one solution`.
- A `singular matrix`

<summary>🎯Q. what is linear equation and non-linear equation ?</summary>

- ![alt text](image-3.png)
- `linear equation` is an equation in which the highest power of the variable is 1. Example : 2x + 3y = 6
- `non-linear equation` is an equation in which the highest power of the variable is greater than 1. Example : x^2 + y^2 = 1
- `linear equations` can be represented in the form of `matrices and vectors`. Example : 2x + 3y = 6 can be represented as [2 3] [x y]^T = 6 (T here is transpose)
- `non-linear equations` cannot be represented in the form of matrices and vectors. Example : x^2 + y^2 = 1 cannot be represented as [x y]^T [x y] = 1
- `linear algebras` is all about the studying the linear equations and their properties.
- `non-linear algebras` is all about the studying the non-linear equations and their properties.   
    - `Algebra` is a branch of mathematics that uses mathematical statements to describe relationships between things that vary.
    - `Linear algebra` is a branch of algebra that studies linear equations, linear functions, and their representations through matrices and vector spaces.
    - `Non-linear algebra` is a branch of algebra that studies non-linear equations, non-linear functions, and their representations through various mathematical structures.

<summary>🎯Q. what is determinant?</summary>

- determinant is a used to `determine if a matrix is singular or non-singular`.
- If determinant is `0` then matrix is `singular` and if determinant is `non-zero` then matrix is `non-singular`.
